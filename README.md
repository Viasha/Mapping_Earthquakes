# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to visually show the magnitude of earthwakes using Leaflet to create the map. There interactive features added to the map using Javscript and GeoJSON make the map more visually effective to read and understand. 

## Maps
* Dark map style using circle marker and pop up

* Satellite map style using dashed lines with point locations

## Earthquake Challenge
* This final map includes tectonic plate data, major earthquake data with a color coded legend to visually show the magnitude of the earthquakes. There is also a legend to navigate between map styles and included data.
